# Examination of state-level nonmetropolitan mortality penalty patterns reveal heterogeneity across the nation, 1999-2016
## Introduction

Here I provide the data and code for replicating the findings presented in the data visualization that illustrates heterogeneity in the emergence of the nonmetropolitan mortality penalty in the United States.

## Data
All data are state-level and obtained through CDC Wonder.
